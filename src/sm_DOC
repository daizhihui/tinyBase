*** Design ***

[Metadata Management]
Two system catalogs(relcat and attrcat) are defined exactly same as the project
description. 'relcat' relation consists of relName, tupleLength, attrCount, and
indexCount. 'attrcat' relation consists of relName, attrName, offSet, attrType,
attrLength, and indexNo. Since there is no index on these relations, they are 
maintained only by RM component.

When a database is opened, these catalogs are also opened and kept opened until
the database is closed.

[Index Management]
When creating a new index, the offset of the indexed attribute is assigned to 
the index number. Since only one index may be created for each attribute of a 
relation, this scheme is obviously enough.

[Other Assumptions]
-DBname is max 24 bytes long, and doesn't contain spaces or '/' (in order to
prevent security exploits).
-Each line of data file (for load command) is max 2047 bytes long.


*** Testing ***

[Correctness]
I was able to test most of commands implemented in this part very easily, due
to the interactive prompt. However, there was no way to confirm whether the 
index was working correctly or not. Thus, I implemented an indexscan based
'print' command so that I could verify the index. If 'useindex' parameter 
(which can be set by 'set' command) is nonnegative, its value means the index
number to be scanned when printing all tuples. sm_test.3 includes test cases.

[Robustness]
Since the parser takes care of many invalid inputs, there were not many issues
regarding robustness. sm_test.2 includes test cases, which include creating a
table with duplicated attribute names, drop system catalogs, etc.


*** Etc. ***

-Makefile.parser was merged to Makefile.
-No known bugs.
-Some of shared data in /usr/class/cs346/redbase/data/ were used in the testing
process.
